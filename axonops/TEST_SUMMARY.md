bundle exec rspec

# Run specific unit test
bundle exec rspec spec/unit/recipes/agent_spec.rb

# List integration test suites (requires Kitchen + Vagrant/Docker)
bundle exec kitchen list

# Run all integration tests
bundle exec kitchen test

# Run specific integration test
bundle exec kitchen test agent-ubuntu-2004

# Run tests for a specific platform
bundle exec kitchen test -p ubuntu-20.04
```
