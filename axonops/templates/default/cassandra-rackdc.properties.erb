# This file is used by GossipingPropertyFileSnitch and will be
# automatically overwritten by the snitch if certain properties
# are missing, so you shouldn't store any extra state here.
#
# The snitch will use this file to determine which nodes are in the
# local datacenter and rack. It will also attempt to determine the
# public IP or hostname to use for itself: first by looking for an
# uncommented line starting with "prefer_local" below, and then by
# querying an EC2 metadata service for a public IP, and finally by
# reverse-looking up its own hostname if all else fails.

# These properties are used with GossipingPropertyFileSnitch
dc=<%= @datacenter %>
rack=<%= @rack %>

# prefer_local specifies whether to use the local IP address or the public IP
# for communication with other nodes (for example, within the same rack).
# Uncomment the following line to use the local IP address:
# prefer_local=true
